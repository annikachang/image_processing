and luma (weighted sum of RGB channel) are offered as channels)
Example : 'red-component image-name mask-name dest-image-name'
To blur: 'blur image-name mask-name dest-image-name'
To sharpen: 'sharpen image-name mask-name dest-image-name'

GUI (To use our GUI and begin image processing) :
Load : an image is loaded by pressing 'Open a file' and choosing a file path.
Operation : After valid file path (extension is one of: ppm, jpg, png, bmp) is loaded,
image can be manipulated using command buttons to the left and filter will be applied to the
displayed image automatically.
Note : Brighten takes in an increment so user can type or scroll increment below the command.
If no increment given, error message will pop up on screen.
Save : The image displayed can also be saved by clicking 'Save a file' and typing in a image name
with a valid extension in the top bar. Users can also select where to export the image.
Errors : Errors will be displayed through pop ups on the GUI.

Note: each command has to be typed exactly in the order specified here, ie the command is first
and then each parameter in that order
